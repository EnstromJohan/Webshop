# Webshop - School assignment
In this lab, I have developed a CRUD application in C# for a webshop that sells films, using MongoDB to manage the film inventory. 
The database will include pre-loaded film details such as titles, genres, and prices, with functionality for all CRUD operations. 
Initially designed as a console application, there's an option to upgrade it to a graphical interface for improved user interaction.
